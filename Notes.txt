Concept: 

Make a JS application to take user data for API call or database pull to retireve lat/lng from address autocomplete

use lat/lng as center point for leaflet map

display house pricing via heatmap/cloropleth | method of showing house pricing intensity in one layer

> other aspects that affect the C.O.L in additional layer? maybe cluster marker layer?
>Layer needs: base map, marker made by user data, heat map that will consist of all price-markers made into heatmap, more as needed?


see chapter 6 hmk for API call
chapter 12 for scrape / mongoDB / JS communication
chapter 12 for NoSQL activities to assist with python -> mongoDB communication
